    <h1 class="mt-4">About Me</h1>
    <p> I am currently studying towards an MEng Computer Science degree and am set to graduate in July 2021 with a 2:1 honours degree from the 
        University of Portsmouth. My aspirations are to secure a Graduate Data Analyst position or similar to 
        utilise my analytical skills and knowledge that I have gained in the area during my studies and work experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Born in Canada in 1997, I moved to the UK at the age of 7 and have lived the majority of my life here. I attended Tomlinscote School and Sixth 
        Form College. At A-levels I studied Maths, Physics and Business and have always been massively interested and motivated by numerical probelm 
        solving. I took this with me to University, starting off studying Mechanical Engineering but switching to BSc Computer Science after
        discovering my passion for computer coding and computers in general.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My time at University taught me just as much about being a functioning adult as it did about computer science.
        During A-levels and my first year at Uni I was certainly not prepared for the self-discipline and independence
        that is required to succeed at University. However, I have become excellent organisationally, meeting deadlines
        and being pro-active about completing tasks. I truly believe that these are the most important skills I have
        learned from University because a person can be taught to understand complicated algorithms but it is much harder
        for a person to break out of bad habits.
