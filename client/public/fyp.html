    <h2>Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data in The Web</h2>

            <p>
                For my bachelors degree project I developed a sentiment analysis model that could be deployed on a web server
                and allow users to upload .CSV files and get sentiment analysis results on twitter data from the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I employed the use of several innovative methods to achieve this. Firstly, I used GloVe word embeddings because it is an 
                algorithm very good at assigning similar words, vectors that are near eachother in a euclidean space. This, famously, allows you to
                code things like 'Queen - Woman + Man = King'. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, I developed a bespoke LSTM recurrent neural network using Tensorflow and Keras to make predictions on one of the 3 sentiment 
                classes: Positive, Neutral, Negative. LSTM was used becuase it is a recurrent neural network, meaning it processes sequential data very well.
                The prime reason was that it can remember long term dependencies in text to a very high standard. Meaning that more information 
                is considered in the prediction of the class.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the trained, tensorflow, LSTM model was packaged and deployed into a Node.js application where users could upload CSV files to the website and receive predictions on their data in minutes.
