                This unit focused very heavily on MPI to perform parallel computations and touched on GPU parallelism towards the end of the term.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this unit I implemented an MPI Task Farm to perform the computations of a Prime Number Sieve on a distributed memory system. 
                The system that was being used was the Universities own Hadoop Cluster of 12 computing nodes. Furthermore, the MPJ Express 
                framework was used to implement MPI programs in the Java programming language. Prime number sieves are functions that find all 
                prime numbers upo to a given value. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The method of parallelisation that I chose had several advantages; Its very scalable and requires very little, if any, changes to the code
                to have this running on 100's or even 1000's of different machienes and It did achieve a parallel speedup, even for such a simple problem. However, 
                I learnt that parllelisation of programs is highly suited to problems with huge sizes and not so much small problems. So, in my example parallel 
                speedup was not achieved until searching for all primes less than a million. Upwards of 1 million and the speedup will continue to grow.
